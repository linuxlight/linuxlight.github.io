Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D. student at [UIUC](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), advised by Prof. [Ram Alagappan](https://ramalagappan.github.io/) and Prof. [Aishwarya Ganesan](https://aishwaryaganesan.github.io/) in the [DASSL](https://dassl-uiuc.github.io/). 
My primary research interests are in operating systems, distributed systems, and storage systems.

Before joining UIUC, I graduated with a double B.S. in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering in 2022 from [Chung-Ang University](https://neweng.cau.ac.kr/index.do), where I worked with Prof. [Yongseok Son](https://sites.google.com/view/syslab-cau/professor) on memory management and file systems.
